## 1. Correspondence Between OLED and the Pegasus Chip Pins

The photoresistor on the RGB board corresponds to GPIO9 (ADC2) on the core board.

## 2. **Compile**

1. Copy the `13_adcligh` directory to the `applications\sample\wifi-iot\app` directory within the Oniro source code
2. Modify the `BUILD.gn` in the `applications\sample\wifi-iot\app` directory of the Oniro source code by replacing the `features` variable with:

```
    features = [
        ...
        "13_adclight:adc_light_demo",
        ...
    ]
```
3. In the file `config.py` located at `device\soc\hisilicon\ws63v100\sdk\build\config\target_config\ws63`, locate the section labeled `'ws63-liteos-app'`. Within this section, add the following code to the `'ram_component'` field:
```
"adc_light_demo"
```

4. In the file `ohos.cmake` located at `device\soc\hisilicon\ws63v100\sdk\libs_url\ws63\cmake`, locate the section labeled `"ws63-liteos-app"`. Within this section, find the `set(COMPONENT_LIST` statement and append the following code to its argument list:
```
"adc_light_demo"
```
5. Execute the following command in the root directory of the Oniro SDK: `rm -rf out && hb set -p nearlink_dk_3863 && hb build -f`

6. If the compilation fails, you can use a serial port assistant with the baud rate set to 115200, and send the AT command (AT+SYSINFO\n) to the development board. If the returned SDK version is lower than SDK Version: 1.10.102, you need to replace the ADC-related driver files. For specific steps, refer to the "replacement_steps.txt" file in the adc_driver directory.

## 3. Result

After flashing the file, press the reset button to start the program. When you completely cover the photoresistor on the RGB board with your hand, the serial port will print high-level values for a period of time. When you remove the obstruction, the serial port will print low-level values.
